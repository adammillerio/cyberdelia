## Writing Shell Commands
The format for a shell command is the following:
```bash
/path/to/working/dir>
echo command
```

ie:
```bash
~/code>
echo "Hello"
```

If it is a machine other than the local machine, add an @ with some relevant information about the location it is being ran:
```bash
~/code@ravenholm>
echo "Hello"
```

## Bulleted Lists

* A line with multiple sentences can use periods of course. However, the last line should always not have one
